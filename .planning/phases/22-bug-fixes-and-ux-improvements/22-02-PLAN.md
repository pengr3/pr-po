<objective>
Fix Firestore permission errors for procurement users on Projects tab and ensure delivery fees are included in project expense totals.

Purpose: Procurement users get console errors when viewing Projects because the users collection listener fires without proper permissions. Delivery fees saved during "Delivered" status change are not reflected in expense aggregation queries which only sum total_amount.

Output: No permission errors for read-only project viewers, delivery fees automatically captured in all expense totals.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Guard users collection listener with edit permission check</name>
  <files>app/views/projects.js</files>
  <action>
  Modify the `loadActiveUsers()` function (projects.js, around line 371) to check edit permissions before setting up the onSnapshot listener on the users collection.

  The users list is only needed for the personnel pill selector (Phase 20 edit feature). Read-only users (like procurement role) don't need it and will get Firestore permission-denied errors because security rules only allow super_admin and operations_admin to list users.

  **Add permission guard at the top of `loadActiveUsers()`:**
  ```javascript
  async function loadActiveUsers() {
      // Personnel pill selector is an edit feature - skip for view-only users
      // Firestore rules only allow super_admin/operations_admin to list users
      const canEdit = window.canEditTab?.('projects');
      if (canEdit === false) {
          console.log('[Projects] Skipping user load (view-only mode)');
          return;
      }

      try {
          // ... existing code unchanged
      }
  }
  ```

  Also add an error callback to the existing `onSnapshot` call (line 378) as a safety net, so that even if the guard is somehow bypassed, the error is handled gracefully instead of throwing an unhandled exception:
  ```javascript
  const listener = onSnapshot(usersQuery, (snapshot) => {
      // ... existing success handler unchanged
  }, (error) => {
      console.warn('[Projects] Users listener error (likely permissions):', error.message);
  });
  ```

  This follows the pattern established in the project where `canEditTab` returns `false` for users without edit permission and `undefined` when permissions haven't loaded yet (backward compatible -- `undefined !== false`, so the listener still fires for users whose permissions are loading).
  </action>
  <verify>
  1. Log in as a procurement user and navigate to Projects tab
  2. Browser console should show "[Projects] Skipping user load (view-only mode)" instead of permission-denied errors
  3. Log in as super_admin and navigate to Projects tab -- personnel pill selector loads normally with user list
  4. No Firestore permission-denied errors in browser console for either role
  </verify>
  <done>
  Procurement users can view the Projects tab without Firestore permission errors. The users collection listener only fires for roles that have edit permission on projects.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Include delivery fee in PO total_amount at write time</name>
  <files>app/views/procurement.js</files>
  <action>
  Modify the `updatePOStatus()` function in procurement.js to add the delivery fee to `total_amount` when status changes to "Delivered". This is the cleanest approach because all existing expense aggregation queries across the app (finance.js, project-detail.js) use `sum('total_amount')` and will automatically pick up the fee without modification.

  In the Delivered status block (around line 3880-3883), after setting `updateData.delivery_fee = deliveryFee`, also update total_amount:

  **Current code (lines 3880-3883):**
  ```javascript
  } else if (newStatus === 'Delivered') {
      updateData.delivered_at = serverTimestamp();
      updateData.delivered_date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
      updateData.delivery_fee = deliveryFee;
  }
  ```

  **Updated code:**
  ```javascript
  } else if (newStatus === 'Delivered') {
      updateData.delivered_at = serverTimestamp();
      updateData.delivered_date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
      updateData.delivery_fee = deliveryFee;
      // Add delivery fee to total_amount so expense aggregation queries
      // (which sum total_amount) automatically include delivery costs
      if (deliveryFee > 0) {
          // Need to read current total_amount from the PO data
          // The PO data is available from the poData array in this scope
          const poDoc = await getDoc(poRef);
          const currentTotal = poDoc.data()?.total_amount || 0;
          updateData.total_amount = currentTotal + deliveryFee;
      }
  }
  ```

  IMPORTANT: The `poRef` is already defined on line 3887 as `const poRef = doc(db, 'pos', poId)`. The `getDoc` call needs to happen BEFORE the `updateDoc` call. Restructure so:
  1. `poRef` is defined before the if/else block (move it up from line 3887)
  2. In the Delivered branch, read the current document to get `total_amount`
  3. Add delivery fee to it

  Make sure `getDoc` is imported from firebase.js. Check the existing imports at the top of procurement.js -- if `getDoc` is not already imported, add it.

  Also ensure the `poRef` variable is declared before the status branching logic so it's available in the Delivered block. Currently `const poRef = doc(db, 'pos', poId)` is at line 3887 after the if/else block -- move it to before the block (around line 3859).

  The `delivery_fee` field is preserved separately for display purposes (PO details modal shows it at procurement.js:4119-4123), while `total_amount` now represents the complete cost including delivery.
  </action>
  <verify>
  1. In Procurement, change a PO's status to "Delivered" and enter a delivery fee (e.g., 500)
  2. Check Firestore directly (browser console or Firebase console) -- the PO document should show `total_amount` = original item total + 500
  3. Navigate to Finance > Project List and click Refresh -- the project's Total Expense should include the delivery fee
  4. Click the project to open expense modal -- materials total should include the delivery fee
  5. Verify the PO details modal still shows the delivery fee separately
  </verify>
  <done>
  Delivery fees are added to total_amount at write time. All expense aggregation queries across Finance and Project Detail views automatically include delivery fees without modification. The delivery_fee field remains for display purposes.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Log in as procurement user -- navigate to Projects tab -- no console errors
2. Log in as super_admin -- navigate to Projects tab -- personnel pill selector works normally
3. Mark a PO as Delivered with a delivery fee -- total_amount in Firestore includes the fee
4. Finance Project List shows expense totals that include delivery fees
5. Project detail expense calculation includes delivery fees
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Zero Firestore permission-denied errors for procurement users viewing Projects
- Delivery fees are reflected in all project expense totals via total_amount inclusion
- No double-counting of delivery fees (only added once at write time)
- No regressions in PO status tracking or project permissions
</success_criteria>
