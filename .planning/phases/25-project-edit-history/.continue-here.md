<current_state>
v2.2 Workflow & UX Enhancements milestone is COMPLETE. All 11 phases (15-25) executed and verified. 37 plans shipped this milestone, 72 total across all milestones (v1.0, v2.0, v2.1, v2.2).

Phases 24 and 25 were the final phases, executed together in this session:
- Phase 24: Rejection Reason Passthrough (1 plan) — fixed field name mismatch, TR rejection visibility, dynamic rejector attribution
- Phase 25: Project Edit History (2 plans) — edit history module + Firestore rules, then wired into 7 mutation points with UI button

Firestore security rules were deployed to production (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`) for the edit_history subcollection.

The milestone is ready for audit or archival.

<remaining_work>
No execution work remains. Next milestone lifecycle step:

- `/gsd:audit-milestone` — verify requirements, cross-phase integration, E2E flows
- OR `/gsd:complete-milestone` — skip audit, archive directly
- OR `/gsd:verify-work` — manual acceptance testing
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Phases 24 and 25 executed together (independent phases, wave 1 parallel)
- Phase 25-02 checkpoint approved after human testing confirmed Edit History works
- Added datetime formatting (time + date) to edit history per user feedback during checkpoint
- Firestore rules deployed mid-execution to unblock edit_history reads (permission denied error)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. Milestone complete.

<context>
The v2.2 milestone has been shipping since 2026-02-06. All 11 phases are done. The user has been doing UAT throughout execution. The natural next step is either auditing the milestone for completeness or archiving it and starting a new milestone.

There are some untracked files from earlier work (backup files, debug notes, previous milestone audit) that aren't part of the current execution.
</context>

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:audit-milestone` to verify v2.2 milestone requirements, cross-phase integration, and E2E flows before archiving. Use `/clear` first for a fresh context window.
