# Phase 98 Verification — UI Fixes Bundle

**Verdict: `human_needed`.** All automated (grep/file-read) must-haves across the 4 slices pass, syntax is valid for every modified JS module, and a cross-view consumer audit found + fixed one shared-class regression (notification dropdown). The remaining items are inherently visual/functional and require browser UAT against PROD Firebase (no automated harness exists for these UI behaviors in this zero-build SPA).

## Method

Inline goal-backward verification by the execute-phase orchestrator (the standard
subagent verifier path is gsd-sdk-dependent; the SDK is not available on this machine,
so verification was performed inline with full plan + diff context). Each plan's
`<verify>` automated commands were executed; results below. Source changes were also
audited for cross-view consumers of every shared class/field touched.

## Per-Plan Results

### 98-01 Client Contact Split (`app/views/clients.js`) — automated PASS
| Must-have (truth) | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Two Phone/Email inputs replace Contact Details (create + edit) | grep `newClientPhone`/`newClientEmail`/`edit-phone`/`edit-email`; no `newContactDetails`/`edit-details` | ✅ |
| Save blocked unless ≥1 of Phone/Email (D-03) | grep at-least-one guard string | ✅ |
| Save blocked on malformed non-empty Email; phone-only OK (D-04) | grep `isValidEmail` + handler logic | ✅ |
| List shows Phone+Email separately; legacy fallback (D-02/D-05) | grep `<th>Phone>`/`<th>Email>`, `client.contact_details` fallback, `colspan=6` | ✅ |
| Detail modal Phone/Email rows + legacy fallback | grep `Contact (legacy)` + Phone/Email labels | ✅ |
| All new display points escapeHTML'd (D-06) | inspected — every new `${client.*}` wrapped | ✅ |
| No CSV export added | grep csv/exportClients → none | ✅ |
| ES-module syntax valid | `node --check` | ✅ |
| **Human:** form validation toasts, legacy-client fallback render, modal legacy row | browser | ⏳ pending |

### 98-02 Notifications Alignment (`app/views/notifications.js`, `styles/components.css`) — automated PASS
| Must-have (truth) | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| History rows are inline single-line (D-07) | renderRows inline markup; no `.notif-row-body` in history rows | ✅ |
| Fixed-width label column → constant message-start-x (D-08) | `.notif-row-label flex:0 0 160px` (sized to REGISTRATION PENDING) | ✅ |
| Time + ✓ right-aligned consistently (D-09) | `.notif-row-time margin-left:auto` | ✅ |
| TYPE_META / dropdown `.na-*` / truncation unchanged (D-10) | `.na-*` present + unmodified; **dropdown base classes restored (see deviation)** | ✅ |
| Conflicting inline styles removed | grep — no `display:flex;align-items:flex-start` on row; label color-only inline | ✅ |
| Label still escaped | grep `escapeHTML(meta.label)` | ✅ |
| ES-module syntax valid | `node --check` | ✅ |
| **Human:** rows single-line; message-x constant; REGISTRATION PENDING not clipped; dropdown unchanged; unread bold+left border | browser vs notifications-alignment-screenshot.png | ⏳ pending |

> **Regression caught & fixed (commit `468268d`):** `.notif-row`/`.notif-row-body` are shared with the bell **dropdown** (`app/notifications.js`). The plan's literal base-class edits would have re-aligned the dropdown badge. Fixed by reverting the shared base rules and scoping the inline layout to `.notif-rows-container` (history only). The dropdown injects into `.notif-dropdown-rows`, so it is provably untouched.

### 98-03 Payables Ref Link (`app/views/finance.js`) — automated PASS (18/18)
| Must-have (truth) | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| PO Ref opens correct PO modal, no "Failed to load PO details" (D-11) | root-cause fix: sites pass doc ID | ✅ (verify-98-03.cjs) |
| PO Summary sites pass `po_doc_id`, not `po.poId` | bug-gone assertions | ✅ |
| `po_doc_id`/`tr_doc_id` threaded buildPOMap → poEntries | grep | ✅ |
| TR rows route to self-contained `viewTRDetailsFromRFP` (not window.viewTRDetails) | grep + no `window.viewTRDetails` dependency in fn | ✅ |
| Truly-unlinked rows = plain text | dash span present | ✅ |
| TR modal window-registered + cleaned up; all TR fields escaped (D-06/D-12) | grep register/delete; all `${tr.*}` escaped | ✅ |
| ES-module syntax valid | `node --check` | ✅ |
| **Human:** PO Ref loads correct PO in both tables (was erroring); TR Ref opens TR modal; direct `#/finance` nav works; unlinked is plain | browser (read-only on PROD) | ⏳ pending |

### 98-04 Home Fit (`styles/hero.css`) — automated PASS
| Must-have (truth) | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Vertical compression applied (D-15) | `.hero-subtitle` no `margin-bottom:4rem`; `.nav-card-icon` no `font-size:4rem`; `.hero-title` no `3rem` | ✅ |
| 3+2 grouping preserved (D-14) | `repeat(3,1fr)` + `repeat(2,1fr)` + centering calc present | ✅ |
| `max-width:1200px` caps preserved (D-16) | ≥2 declarations present (3 found) | ✅ |
| 1024/768/480 media blocks preserved (D-16) | all three present | ✅ |
| `.quick-stats` untouched | grid rule unchanged | ✅ |
| classes are home-only (no cross-view shrink) | `.nav-card`/`.hero-*`/`.dept-cards` referenced only in home.js | ✅ |
| **Human:** all 5 tiles + hero title fit above the fold on ≥1080px-tall load; bottom row not clipped; still legible; reflow at <1024/<768 | browser on wide monitor | ⏳ pending |

## Requirement Traceability
All four plans declare `requirements: []` (no formal REQUIREMENTS.md IDs mapped to this UI-fix phase). Phase frontmatter `phase_req_ids: null`. Nothing to cross-reference.

## Regression / Drift Gates
- **Cross-view consumer audit:** PASS (1 issue found in 98-02, fixed; 98-01/03/04 confirmed isolated to their views).
- **Firestore rules test suite** (`mocha test/firestore.test.js`): NOT RUN — out of scope. No slice touched `firestore.rules` or schema (all plan threat models dispose rule changes as "accept"/no-change), and the suite requires the Firebase emulator (not running this session). No rules-surface change → no rules regression possible from this phase.
- **Schema drift:** none — only JS/CSS edited; Firestore is schemaless and no rules/ORM files changed.
- **Build gate:** N/A — zero-build static SPA.

## Human Verification Items (8) → see 98-HUMAN-UAT.md
Persisted to `98-HUMAN-UAT.md` (status: partial). These surface in `/gsd-progress` and `/gsd-audit-uat` until tested via `/gsd-verify-work 98`.

## Conclusion
Code is structurally complete and correct per all automated checks. Browser UAT was subsequently run by the user (`98-UAT.md`): **7 pass, 1 skip (no TR row in data), 0 issues**. Round 1 surfaced two real defects that the automated checks could not catch — a **blocker** (PO Ref FirebaseError: RFP `po_doc_id` empty → empty-segment `doc()` call) and a **cosmetic** issue (oversized ✓ from a dropped inline font-size). Both were root-caused and fixed (`9960d99`, `9d7d845`) and **re-tested pass**. Phase is **genuinely verified and complete**. (Note: the earlier same-day "batch-approved" disposition was premature — it would have shipped the PO Ref blocker; running the real UAT corrected that.)
