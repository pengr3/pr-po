## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Email notifications | Requires Cloud Functions or external service; security and simplicity priority - all communication happens in-app |
| Automated email verification | Invitation codes provide sufficient security control; manual approval prevents abuse |
| OAuth/SSO login | Email/password sufficient for internal system; complexity not warranted yet |
| Two-factor authentication | Enhanced security not critical for internal procurement system initially; can add later |
| Mobile app | Desktop-first for operational efficiency; mobile deferred to future |
| Real-time chat/comments | Not core to procurement workflow; focus on structured data |
| Comprehensive audit logging | Adds complexity; can use Firestore triggers later if compliance requires |
| Password reset custom UI | Firebase provides built-in email reset; custom UI not critical for v2.0 |
| BOQ creation/editing in system | BOQ created externally, only uploaded for reference |
| Automated expense tracking | Manual MRF creation provides oversight and control |
