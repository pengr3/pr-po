# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-12)

**Core value:** Projects tab must work - it's the foundation where project name and code originate, and everything in the procurement system connects to it.
**Current focus:** Phase 26 - Security & Roles Foundation (v2.3 Services Department Support)

## Current Position

Phase: 26 of 31 (Security & Roles Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-12 — v2.3 roadmap created with 6 phases covering 54 requirements

Progress: [████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░] 80% (25/31 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 93 (v1.0: 10, v2.0: 26, v2.1: 14, v2.2: 43)
- Average duration: Not yet tracked systematically
- Total execution time: ~95+ days across 4 milestones

**By Milestone:**

| Milestone | Phases | Days | Avg/Phase |
|-----------|--------|------|-----------|
| v1.0 | 4 | 59 | 14.8 |
| v2.0 | 6 | 64 | 10.7 |
| v2.1 | 3 | 2 | 0.7 |
| v2.2 | 11 | 5 | 0.5 |
| v2.3 | 6 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- v2.1: 0.2 days per plan (dramatic improvement from v2.0)
- v2.2: 0.14 days per plan (sustained high velocity)
- Trend: Stable - high velocity maintained

*Updated after v2.3 roadmap creation*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting v2.3 work:

- Phase 26: Services mirrors Projects (reuse patterns, duplicate UI modules)
- Phase 26: Security Rules and role templates come first (foundation before UI)
- Phase 27: Parallel query pattern for shared sequence (acceptable race condition risk at current scale)
- Phase 29: MRF form integration modifies existing code (higher risk, comes after Services UI validated)
- v2.3 General: No data migration needed (existing data is sample/practice data)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
