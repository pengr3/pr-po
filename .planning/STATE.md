## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Build Projects first, auth/permissions later (v2.0) — Core value is project tracking; get foundation working before securing it
- Project lifecycle starts at lead stage — Track all expenses from first contact, measure pursuit vs win
- Two status fields (Internal + Project Status) — Internal tracks Operations steps, Project Status tracks client relationship
- Project codes include client: CLMC_CLIENT_YYYY### — Group projects by client, see win/loss rates per client over time
- Freetext personnel field in v1.0 — No user system yet; structured assignment deferred to v2.0 when auth exists
- New page UI for project create/edit — Projects have many fields; full page provides better UX than cramped modal

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
