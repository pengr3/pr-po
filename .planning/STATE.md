# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-30)

**Core value:** Projects tab must work - it's the foundation where project name and code originate, and everything in the procurement system connects to it.
**Current focus:** v2.0 - Authentication & Permissions (defining requirements)

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
